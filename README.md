# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! 🧩

This is a simple, interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's a two-player game where you can play against a friend and challenge them to a match! 🏆


## 🕹️ How to Play

1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. The first player is "X", and the second player is "O".
2. Players take turns to place their mark on the grid.
3. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game! 🎉
4. If all spaces are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw. 🤝

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styled the game board and made the UI visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented the game logic and interactivity.
